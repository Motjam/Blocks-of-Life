# Blocks-of-Life

Please see the attached files they are seeded to "0" and go to 9999. They range in file sizes beccause the data compression varies between the amount of pixels/space used to generate the PFP image or "Blocks of Life" Character. No file should be larger than 2kb. All files should be in webp as that is optimal for this project. Thank you.

This repo contains not only the PFP collection images but also the SPA that utilizes the "Game of Life" code to assign the rules to the pixels on a bounded-grid (300x300) via Javascript. All new editions or additive editions will be posted here.
